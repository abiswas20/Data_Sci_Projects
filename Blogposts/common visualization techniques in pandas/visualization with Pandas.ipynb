    "Pandas is perhaps the most popular library in data science when it comes to analyzing data. It's power comes from pulling the entire dataset in the memory for fast access and creating DataFrames to provide a great way to visualize, slice and dice data. While this way of handling memory limits its appropriateness with very large datasets, pandas is the King when it comes to large datasets up until the mid-single digits in GB. Apart from being an analytical library, it also gives the user the ability to create quick visualizations using a easy to use syntax. True, it doesn't have the flexibility of a complete visualization library like Matplotlib or Seaborn, but this feature is incredibly useful in the earlier stages of analysis, prototyping and modeling. In this post we'll look at some of the more common visualization techniques in the way of exploring a dataset on New York City street tree census from 2015. Please note that this is by no means supposed to be an exploratory data analysis of the dataset. My intent in using this dataset is simpy to use it to demonstrate the various techniques. So let's get started without wasting any more digital ink.\n",

As mentioned in the official [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13/visualization.html), these methods are essentially wrappers around matplotlib. That is to say that under the hood, such methods send requests to matplotlib which renders the charts. This lends a lot of similarities in the syntax of how arguments are passed to matplotlib and various pandas methods. This will be evident starting right from the first type of chart we discuss - bar charts. "
