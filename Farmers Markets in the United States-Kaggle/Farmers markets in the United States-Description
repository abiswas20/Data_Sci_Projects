Farmers markets are an important way for citizens to eat healthy fresh food while supporting small family farms. This data contains information about all the registered farmers markets in the United States in 2020. This includes the city, county, lat and long, and information about the types of food sold at each market. One criticism of farmers markets is that they are largely inaccessible to many Americans, especially those of low socio-economic status. Does the data reflect this criticism?
