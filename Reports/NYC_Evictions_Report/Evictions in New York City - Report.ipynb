    "New York City is the largest city in the United States and arguably the financial capital of the world. Its cost of living is very high, to the point where Economist Intelligence Unit's 2020 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey puts it in the fourth place in the world. Singapore, Osaka and Hong Kong tied for the first place. It also has one of the most competitive and expensive real estate in the country. As to be expected, a large portion of the businesses and homes are leased properties. This study focuses on such residential properties and their renters. High population density, lack of space for horizontal growth and extensive vertical growth make evictions an unfortunate reality for residents of the city. I looked into residents' household income, their level of education and prevalence of certain types of crime in the neighborhood and how they relate to evictions per capita. Not unexpectedly, there appears to be a strong correlation between all these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the data is categorized by neighborhood, except for arrest data. I could only find arrest data by precinct, making the the study largely exploratory. Thus study is largely exploratory."
